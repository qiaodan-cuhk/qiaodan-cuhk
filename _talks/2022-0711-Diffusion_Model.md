## Abstract
As a new generation model paradigm, the diffusion model was proposed by Peter Abbel in 2020 and has become popular in recent years. In the paper, the thermodynamic diffusion model in physics was introduced into the field of image generation, whose performance exceeded that of GANs. At present, it is promising to become another boom topic as Transformer. In this discussion, we will first explain the technical details and ideas of the diffusion model, then outline the main results of a series of follow-up studies inspired by it. Finally, we will introduce the latest MBRL article based on the diffusion model which is the first attempt to break the barrier between modeling and planning.
